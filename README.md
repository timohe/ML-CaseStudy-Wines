# Machine Learning on a wine dataset
Using this dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality    

For the FS2018 course in Machine Learning at University of Zurich

## Topics
Clustering, Classification and PCA

## To run
1. Don't forget to copy data folder with same folder structure. 
2. Install the requirements from the yml file, maybe `source deactivate;` needed instead of activate.
```
source activate myenvironment;
conda env update -f environment.yml; #use path to env file   
```
3. Use a jupyter notbook with a python 3.5 environment.        

All the code and explanations can be found inside of those notebooks.    

The notebooks can be used interactively, as there is a waiting time of max 30s for a few tasks.     
There is a yml file in the repo to install the additional dependencies.
