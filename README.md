# Machine Learning on a wine dataset
Using this dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality    

For the FS2018 course in Machine Learning at University of Zurich

## Topics
Clustering, Classification and PCA

## To run
I used a jupyter notbook with a python 3.5 environment.    
All the code and descriptions can be found inside of those notebooks.    
The notebooks can be used interactively, as there is a waiting time of max 30s for a few tasks.     
There is a yml file in the repo to install the additional dependencies.
